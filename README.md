## Analysis:
1. Several states in the East, Central, and Southern USA show a negative correlation between the number of homeless individuals and rental prices. In contrast, many states in the West show no clear correlation. Only a few states, such as Alaska, Delaware, and Vermont, demonstrate a positive correlation, indicating that an increase in rental prices is associated with a rise in the number of homeless individuals.
